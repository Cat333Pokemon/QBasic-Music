# QBasic Music
Music that plays on the PC speaker, written in QBasic for MS-DOS

These should work in either Microsoft QBasic or QuickBasic 4.5. Executables require either a 16-bit MS-DOS environment or an emulator like DOSBox.

Compatibility with QB64 is confirmed to be poor do to a different implementation of the PLAY command in regards to program halting.
